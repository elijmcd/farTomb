: Updated SeeLight

The old seelight was really stupid, this works much better....

Okay, here is something i think you will like.
I've heard so many people say, "damn.. its annoying that you
can't grab a light when you are in a dark room". They are
right, it is :P, soooo i decided to add it. These changes will
allow your players to see the light they are carrying when
they are in a dark room, it will also make it possible for them
use it. Hope you find this useful.

I did not include the code to see containers containing a light
nor the possibility to get lights from container, why? because of
the roleplaying factor, you wouldn't see your backpack in the dark,
but ..eh.. you would feel it.. so.. bah!
You are probably thinking "that sounds stupid" ..... i know... ;)
If you really want to add it, but don't know how, send me a mail.

Alot more can and should be added.

Note: this has been updated to work in tbaMUD 3.64.
