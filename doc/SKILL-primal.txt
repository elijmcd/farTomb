     While skimming through the procedures for casting spells and a
new mortal ability to create eq I added, armweap.c, I came up with an
interesting fee for casting special spells and creating mortal eq.
Primal Energy. Some of you may know it from the GodWars codebase. Well,
here's my addition for primal energy. Please give credit to Andra for
basic design, and nothing more. Maybe an email telling me you used it.
I know, I know, its a fairly, well, easy snippet. :)

 NOTE - This is designed for ASCII Pfiles 

*** STRUCTS.H ***


In struct char_player_data, near the bottom add:
   int primal;             /* PC's Primal Energy                   */

int struct char_file_u, near the bottom again add:
   int primal;             /* PC's Primal Energy                   */

Finally, in struct char_data, add:
   int primal;             /* PC's Primal Energy                   */

Wasn't that exciting? :p



*** PFDEFAULTS.H ***
ADD:
#define PFDEF_PRIMAL         0


*** UTILS.H      ***
WIth all the other defines:
#define GET_PRIMAL(ch) (ch)->player.primal

*** DB.C         ***
In save_char, after:
    if(GET_WEIGHT(ch) != PFDEF_HEIGHT)
      fbprintf(fl, "Wate: %d\n", GET_WEIGHT(ch));
Add:
    if(GET_PRIMAL(ch) != PFDEF_PRIMAL)
      fbprintf(fl, "Prim: %d\n", GET_PRIMAL(ch));

In load_char, after:
	else if(!strcmp(tag, "Plyd"))
	  ch->player.time.played = num;
Add:
        else if(!strcmp(tag, "Prim"))
          GET_PRIMAL(ch) = num;

That should be just about everything you need, bare minimum, to use
primal energy.
