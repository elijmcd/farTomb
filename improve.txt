Subject: improve_skill function

This code goes into fight.c, and in act.offensive.c, ensure you put a void
improve_skill(etc).  Finally, where skills are successful, do
improve_skill(ch, <skill name>).

void improve_skill(struct char_data *ch, int skill)
{
  extern char *spells[];
  int percent = GET_SKILL(ch, skill);
  int newpercent;
  char skillbuf[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];

  if (number(1, 200) > GET_WIS(ch) + GET_INT(ch))
     return;
  if (percent >= 97 || percent <= 0)
     return;
  newpercent = number(1, 3);
  percent += newpercent;
  SET_SKILL(ch, skill, percent);
  if (newpercent >= 4) {
     sprintf(skillbuf, "You feel your skill in %s improving.", spells[skill]);
     send_to_char(skillbuf, ch);
  }
}


Before when your skill went up it would say "You feel your skill in 62
improving" instead of "You feel your skill in <whatever 62 is>
improving".. put the code in fight.c, then in act.offensive.c, put a
"void improve_skill(struct char_data *ch, int skill);" at the top, then in
anything you want to be improved on success.. <randomly> put a
"improve_skill(ch, SKILL_x);" on the line below the
successful part of the code.. i.e.
in bash: "improve_skill(ch, SKILL_BASH);" and then when you got bash off,
it would check the random, etc.. if you got it, it would set your skill
1-3 points higher.. and say "You feel your skill in bash improving."
