fount fountain~
Constructed of marble so finely formed it seems like clay, the ancient fountain of Broadmoor is a wonder of graceful curvature and intricate detailing. Unfortunately, the ground has given way underneath, causing it to obtain a somewhat comical tilt. Curiously, however, the flow of water through and around its many twisting troughs seems undisturbed by the acute lean, and continues to adhere tightly to the form of the fountain.

small antiquated wagon~
A long time ago, this small wagon was immaculately carved and painted, but it now lies abandoned and unused amid grass and bushes, slowly giving way to the moss and vines which cover it.
The old rickety door hangs tantalizingly ajar...

eerie crystal ball~
As you gaze into the crystal the light itself appears to be broken and shining back in on itself continually, in a nearly imperceptible geometric pattern of refraction and reflection. You sense it beckoning you to enter its wilderness of mirrors...
